										<p><strong>Professionals in Education Lunch Series</strong></p>
										<p>Students often believe that a career in education is limited to the classroom. This year, we are initiating a new lunch series that invites professionals in education to talk about their career experiences with Stanford students. This series serves to expose students to the sheer diversity of pathways into education careers, and it is an opportunity for students to hear stories, ask questions, and engage in conversation with leaders in the field.</p>
										<p>
										We are seeking professionals who work or have worked in education policy, research, law, journalism, technology, non-profits, administration, teaching, and more. Why did you choose to go into education? How is working in education intellectually stimulating? What are the challenges? What are the rewards? What kind of person might enjoy the career(s) you have pursued? How is the work-life balance in that career? If you are interested in sharing your professional experiences and inspiring Stanford students to pursue careers in education, please contact stanfordsprees@gmail.com.</p>
										<p>
										For times and dates, please check our <a href = "#">calendar</a>.</p>
										<p><strong>SPREES Signature Events</strong></p>
										<p>
										Each quarter, SPREES organizes a major event designed to bring the Stanford community together and talk about the essentialness of attracting talented college graduates into education, especially teaching.
										</p>
										<p><em>Coming Soon: Fall Signature Event</em></p>
										<p>This fall, SPREES is gathering your favorite professors from across the university to discuss their respective paths to teaching, how they have honed their craft, and which aspects of teaching they have found to be rewarding and intellectually stimulating. Moreover, the panel will engage each other in conversation on what role teaching should play at a research university and why it is so important for top university students to seriously consider teaching at all grade levels.</p>
										<p>Come back soon when we announce the time and date as well as who will be on the panel!</p>
