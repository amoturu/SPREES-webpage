										<h2><a name = "mission">Our Mission</a></h2>
										<p>The Stanford Pre-Education Society's mission is to inspire Stanford students to pursue careers in education, broadly including teaching, administration, research, policy, tech, entrepreneurship, law, nonprofits, journalism, higher education, international education, and more. <br>
										We intend to guide and support Stanford students as they make academic and extracurricular choices towards a career in education. <br>
										We plan to build a stronger and more centralized community among Stanford students, faculty, and alumni who are passionate about issues in education and education reform.<br>
										We aim to increase the number of Stanford students who enter the field of education after graduation, particularly in teaching.<br>
										We want Stanford students to perceive teaching as a worthy career choice, one which they will seriously consider when making career decisions.<br>
										We want all students to leave Stanford with a stronger appreciation for the significance and challenges of teaching, and to consider that significance as future world leaders and voting citizens. <br>
										We aspire to become a force in education reform as we elevate the teaching profession and serve as a model for how colleges and universities can attract and support the best graduates into teaching and education - especially at elite institutions like Stanford, where teaching is often overlooked.</p>
										<h2><a name = "history">Our History</a></h2>
										<p>
										The Stanford Pre-Education Society was founded in spring 2013 by a Stanford sophomore. As a pre-education student intending to pursue a career as a teacher, she was frustrated by the gaps in cohesive support services and opportunities afforded to pre-ed students who would benefit from exploring various career options in education. SPREES was founded as a way to provide those opportunities to current and future students with the hope that they would feel less lost and more empowered in choosing to pursue a career in education.<br>
										Multiple experiences converged to form the conception of SPREES: the founder knew she wanted to teach, but did not know at what grade level or subject nor whom to turn to for advice; she was surrounded by pre-med students in the Human Biology core, for whom multiple pre-medical associations existed to provide support; she took Education 101: Introduction to Teaching and Learning, in which Professor Jennifer Wolf challenged students to think critically about the professionalization of teaching and what it means to describe teaching as a "profession"; and she had the opportunity to form a final project for the Education and Society Theme House seminar under Professor Christine Wotipka, who later became an official SPREES advisor.<br>
										SPREES was also created to promote teaching as an attractive career option for students who might never consider it otherwise. The SPREES founder steadfastly believes that education reform efforts will be futile until we can attract the best and brightest from all colleges and universities into teaching as a career and elevate the status of the profession through increased compensation, autonomy, prestige, and standards to entry. These beliefs largely influence the shape that SPREES has assumed and the messages that it advocates.

										<p><strong>Lead SPREES. Reform Education Today.</strong><br>
										Many of us are eager to jump into education reform. But we're not the heads of government agencies or non-profits with the power to dictate policy.

										But leading SPREES to grow and thrive is an act of education reform as we become a model for how colleges and universities can attract the best graduates into teaching and education - especially at elite colleges like Stanford, where teaching is overlooked. The future of education reform depends on our nation's ability to elevate the teaching profession.<br>
										<strong>Let's start now.</strong>
